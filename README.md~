**memorable_quote_bot**
This bot was inspired by my favorite [Abraham Lincoln quote](https://www.askideas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/The-problem-with-quotes-found-on-the-Internet-is-that-they-are-often-not-true.-Abraham-Lincoln.jpg), and of course, on [trippin' through time](reddit.com/r/trippinthroughtime) style humor. I hope it does not disrupt the regular 

So here's a little summary of what the bot does:

starts by fetching the forbidden subreddits from a file
then it fetches the latest comments from /all
it matches it against the regex (which aims for medium-sized non-nested quotes)
also it checks whether the subreddit the comment comes from has banned the bot
if it matches, isn't banned, and the comment hasn't been replied to yet:
    the comment is added to the list
	build_image is called (see below) with the match and the comment's id
	the comment is replied to

the image is built in the following way:

after being called, it creates an empty image
it then selects a random image + signature combo from the archive
based on the image's dimensions it calculates the offset so they are centered
(they were prepared beforehand to always fit in the spot)
the image is pasted together with the signature
then a font is selected for the quote
TODO: make sure this font is the same one as the one in the signatures.
a draw object is created and used to write the quote. textwrap is used to ensure
the lines fit inside their spot.
all is wrapped up, and the image is saved temporarily, uploaded to imgur, and
then then functin returns the url of the image.

I included a script to automate the reduction of images and the generation of
signatures. to use it, run it in the terminal, and when prompted, write "sigs"
(without the quotes) to generate the signature files again from the file
"historical_figures.txt". Write "pics" and the script will iterate the
"old_images" folder and generate the corresponding small suitable image named
"imagenX.png" on the main folder. ("imagen" means "image" in Spanish. :-])
Do this every time you update the list, after removing or adding entries. Make
sure you update both the images and the file before running it!
TODO: unify both scripts
